# Line ChatBot for CS Conversion Programme Application Consultant

## Overview

Welcome to our Line ChatBot designed to assist aspiring students interested in the CS conversion programme application process. This ChatBot provides information, answers queries, and guides users through the application procedure for the Computer Science (CS) conversion programme.

## Getting Started

To use our Line ChatBot for the CS conversion programme application, follow these steps:

1. **Create Line Messaging API Account**:
   - Go to the Line Developer Console and create a Line Messaging API account for your ChatBot.
   - Save the Channel Secret and Channel Access Token provided by Line. You need these to authenticate your bot in the `views.py` file.

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment**:
   - Create a virtual environment based on your operating system in your preferred method. You can use `virtualenv` or `venv` to isolate dependencies.

### Using `virtualenv` (Linux, macOS, and Windows):

1. Install `virtualenv` if you haven't already:

   ```bash
   pip install virtualenv
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   # For Linux and macOS
   virtualenv venv

   # For Windows
   virtualenv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   # For Linux and macOS
   source venv/bin/activate

   # For Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

### Using `venv` (Python 3.3 and later, built-in) - (Linux, macOS, and Windows):

1. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   # For Linux and macOS
   python3 -m venv venv

   # For Windows
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   # For Linux and macOS
   source venv/bin/activate

   # For Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

Once you activate the virtual environment, you can install the required packages using `pip` without affecting the system-wide Python installation. To deactivate the virtual environment, use the command:

```bash
deactivate
```

Remember to activate the virtual environment again whenever you work on your Line ChatBot project.

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Activate the virtual environment you created in the previous step.
   - Use the `pip install` command to install all the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file. This ensures that the necessary libraries are available for your ChatBot.

4. **Ngrok Setup**:
   - Download the `ngrok` executable from the official website. Ngrok is a tool that allows you to create a secure tunnel to your local development server.
   - In your terminal, navigate to the directory where the `ngrok` executable is located, and run the command: `ngrok http 8000`. This assumes that your local development server is running on port 8000.
   - Ngrok will generate an HTTPS link (e.g., `https://6a3b-2001-b400-e209-c92c-1d2e-53de-ca91-62b2.ngrok-free.app`) that you will use for the webhook configuration.

5. **Webhook Configuration**:
   - In the Line Developer Console, configure the Line Messaging API webhook by appending `/line/webhook/` to the end of your ngrok-generated HTTPS link. For example, if your ngrok HTTPS link is `https://6a3b-2001-b400-e209-c92c-1d2e-53de-ca91-62b2.ngrok-free.app`, the webhook URL will be `https://6a3b-2001-b400-e209-c92c-1d2e-53de-ca91-62b2.ngrok-free.app/line/webhook/`.
   - Save the updated webhook URL in the Line Developer Console.

6. **Allow Hosts Configuration**:
   - In your Django project's `settings.py` file, add the ngrok-generated URL (without the `https://`) to the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` list. For example:
     ```
     ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['6a3b-2001-b400-e209-c92c-1d2e-53de-ca91-62b2.ngrok-free.app', '127.0.0.1']
     ```

7. **Update views.py**:
   - Open the `views.py` file in your Django project.
   - At the beginning of the file, add the Channel Secret and Channel Access Token you obtained from the Line Developer Console. These credentials will be used for authentication.

8. **Run the Server**:
   - In your terminal, navigate to your Django project directory and run the command: `python manage.py runserver`. This starts the Django development server, allowing your Line ChatBot to respond to messages.

9. **Add Line Account as Friend**:
   - Add your Line ChatBot as a friend on your Line account by searching for its name.
   - Start interacting with the ChatBot to seek guidance on the CS conversion programme application.

Remember to keep your Channel Secret and Channel Access Token secure and avoid sharing them publicly to ensure the security of your Line ChatBot.
